      This is so easy and so good. It's always the hit of the party and it's
      gone before anything else on the table.

      Stir together the avocado and lemon juice in a serving bowl; add the green
      onion and cilantro; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve
      immediately or store covered in refrigerator with avocado pits in the bowl
      to keep from browning.
